Example native iOS app and example native Android app showcasing Model View Presenter architectural pattern.

***

### Overview

The focus of this project is to show the [Model View Presenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–presenter "Model View Presenter architectural pattern")  architectural pattern in the development of application of various types.  
I talked about the [Model View Presenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–presenter "Model View Presenter architectural pattern")  in two blog posts:

* [Model View Presenter on iOS: no more excuses, write your unit test](https://www.fabrizioduroni.it/2017/08/11/model-view-presenter-architecture-ios-swift-unit-test/)
* [Model View Presenter on Android: unit test for everything](https://www.fabrizioduroni.it/2017/10/27/model-view-presenter-architecture-android-java/)

This architectural pattern let you develop GUI oriented software completely testable. In fact you can develop your application using [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development "Test Driven Development") technique.  
In particular in this repo you will find the same application developed for various platform/languages. This application will display a list of products and show the detail of one of them when a it is selected. Below you can find a simple mockup of the mobile version of this app.

### Supported platform

The application has been developed for various platform/language. At the moment you can find the implementation for:

* iOS using Swift
* Android using Java
